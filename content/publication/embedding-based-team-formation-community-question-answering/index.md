abstract: The number of users who have the appropriate knowledge to answer asked questions
  in community question answering is lower than those who ask questions. Therefore,
  finding expert users who can answer the questions is very crucial and useful. In
  this article, we propose a framework to find experts for given questions and assign
  them the related questions. The proposed model benefits from users’ relations in
  a community along with the lexical and semantic similarities between new question
  and existing answers. Node embedding is applied to the community graph to find similar
  users. Our experiments on four different Stack Exchange datasets show that adding
  community relations improves the performance of expert finding models.
