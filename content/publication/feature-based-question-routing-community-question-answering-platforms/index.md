abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Community question answering (CQA) platforms became popular and
  indispensable sources of information in diﬀerent domains. The success of these platforms
  relies heavily on the timely contribution of their expert users who would answer
  questions. There are many questions that remain unanswered for a long time, if not
  ever, on CQA platforms. In this dissertation, the problem of question routing on
  CQA platforms is addressed, which aims to connect experts to the right questions.
  We introduce and semantically classify 67 features and then train a learn to rank
  framework over ﬁve different CQA datasets. Results show that features based on tags,
  topics, user characteristics and user temporality are eﬀective for question routing.
  Also the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art neural matchmaking methods,
  that lack the interpretation of features, without compromising interpretability.
  The interpretation of features’ inﬂuence helps future research in this ﬁeld to address
  the question routing problem more eﬀectively.&lt;/p&gt;'
summary: Feature-based question routing in community question answering platforms.
