abstract: Prior research has demonstrated that reformulation of queries can significantly
  enhance retrieval effectiveness. Despite notable successes in neural-based query
  reformulation methods, identifying optimal reformulations that cover the same information
  need while enhancing retrieval effectiveness is still challenging. This paper introduces
  a two-step query reformulation framework for generating and selecting optimal target
  query variants which not only achieve higher retrieval performance but also preserve
  the original query's information need. Our comprehensive evaluations on the MS MARCO
  dataset and TREC Deep Learning tracks demonstrate substantial improvements over
  original query's performance.
