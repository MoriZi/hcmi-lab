abstract: Given an expert network, we tackle the problem of finding a team of experts
  that covers a set of required skills and also minimizes the communication cost as
  well as the personnel cost of the team. Since two costs need to be minimized, this
  is a bicriteria optimization problem. We show that the problem of minimizing these
  objectives is NP-hard. We use two approaches to solve this bicriteria optimization
  problem. In the first approach, we propose several (α, β)-approximation algorithms
  that receive a budget on one objective and minimizes the other objective within
  the budget with guaranteed performance bounds. In the second approach, an approximation
  algorithm is proposed to find a set of Pareto-optimal teams, in which each team
  is not dominated by other feasible teams in terms of the personnel and communication
  costs. The proposed approximation algorithms have provable performance bounds. Extensive
  experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
  proposed algorithms.
