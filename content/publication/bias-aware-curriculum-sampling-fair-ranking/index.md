abstract: Neural ranking models are widely used to retrieve and rank relevant documents.
  However, these models may inherit and amplify biases present in the training data,
  posing challenges for fairness and relevance in ranking outputs. In this paper,
  we propose a novel curriculum-based training approach that manages bias exposure
  throughout the training process. We design a bias-aware curriculum that stages the
  exposure of the model to biased samples during the training stages, allowing the
  model to establish a fair relevance baseline. We conduct extensive experiments across
  different LLMs and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results
  demonstrate that our proposed strategy outperforms other bias reduction methods
  in terms of both fairness and relevance, without sacrificing retrieval effectiveness.
