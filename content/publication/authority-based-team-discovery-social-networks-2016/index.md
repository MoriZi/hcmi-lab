abstract: Given a social network of experts, we address the problem of discovering
  a team of experts that collectively holds a set of skills required to complete a
  given project. Most prior work ranks possible solutions by communication cost, represented
  by edge weights in the expert network. Our contribution is to take experts authority
  into account, represented by node weights. We formulate several problems that combine
  communication cost and authority, we prove that they are NP-hard, and we propose
  and experimentally evaluate greedy algorithms to solve them.
summary: Authority-based approaches for team discovery in social networks.
