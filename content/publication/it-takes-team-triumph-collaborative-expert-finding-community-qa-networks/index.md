abstract: The increasing complexity and multidisciplinary nature of queries on Community
  Question Answering (CQA) platforms have rendered the traditional model of individual
  expert response inadequate. This paper tackles the challenge of identifying a group
  of experts whose combined expertise can address such complex inquiries collaboratively,
  leading to more accepted answers. Our approach jointly learns topological and textual
  information extracted from the CQA environment in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive
  experiments on several real-life datasets indicate that our approach improves the
  quality of expert ranks on average 4.6% and 7.1% in terms of NDCG and MAP, respectively,
  compared to the best baseline. The results also reveal that groups formed by our
  approach are more collaborative and on average 61.6% of members recommended by our
  approach are among the true answerers of questions which is around 6.1 times improvement
  compared to the baselines.
