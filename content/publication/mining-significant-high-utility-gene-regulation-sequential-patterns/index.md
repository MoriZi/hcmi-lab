abstract: '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mining frequent gene regulation sequential patterns in time course microarray
  datasets is an important mining task in bioinformatics. Although finding such patterns
  are of paramount important for studying a disease, most existing work do not consider
  gene-disease association during gene regulation sequential pattern discovery. Moreover,
  they consider more absent/existence effects of genes during the mining process than
  taking the degrees of genes expression into account. Consequently, such techniques
  discover too many patterns which may not represent important information to biologists
  to investigate the relationships between the disease and underlying reasons hidden
  in gene regulation sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We propose a utility model by considering both the &lt;em&gt;gene-disease
  association&lt;/em&gt; score and their &lt;em&gt;degrees of expression levels&lt;/em&gt;
  under a biological investigation. We propose an efficient method called &lt;em&gt;Top-HUGS&lt;/em&gt;,
  for discoverying &lt;em&gt;significant high utility gene regulation sequential patterns&lt;/em&gt;
  from a time-course microarray dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this study, the proposed methods were evaluated on a publicly available
  time course microarray dataset. The experimental results show higher accuracies
  compared to the baseline methods. Our proposed methods found that several new gene
  regulation sequential patterns involved in such patterns were useful for biologists
  and provided further insights into the mechanisms underpinning biological processes.
  To effectively work with the proposed method, a web interface is developed to our
  system using Java. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
  for &lt;em&gt;significant high utility gene regulation sequential pattern discovery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'
summary: Methods for mining significant high utility gene regulation sequential patterns
  in biological networks.
