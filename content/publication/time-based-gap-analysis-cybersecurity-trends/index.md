abstract: "This study analyzes cybersecurity trends and proposes a conceptual framework\
  \ to identify cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging topics that need\
  \ to be addressed by researchers in the field. The insights drawn from this framework\
  \ allow for a more proactive approach to identifying cybersecurity patterns and\
  \ emerging threats that will ultimately improve the collective cybersecurity posture\
  \ of the modern society. To achieve this, cybersecurity-oriented content in both\
  \ media and academic corpora, disseminated between 2008 and 2018, were morphologically\
  \ analyzed via text mining. A total of 3,556 academic papers obtained from the top-10\
  \ highly reputable cybersecurity academic conferences, and 4,163 news articles collected\
  \ from the\n            New York Times\n            were processed. The LDA topic\
  \ modeling followed optimal perplexity and coherence scores resulted in 12 trendy\
  \ topics. Next, the time-based gap between these trendy topics was analyzed to measure\
  \ the correlation between media and trendy academic topics. Both convergences and\
  \ divergences between the two cybersecurity corpora were identified, suggesting\
  \ a strong time-based correlation between these resources. This framework demonstrates\
  \ the effective use of automated techniques to provide insights about cybersecurity\
  \ topics of social interest and emerging trends and informs the direction of future\
  \ academic research in this field."
