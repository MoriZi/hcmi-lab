abstract: 'We present EAGER: a tool for answering questions expressed in natural language.
  Core to EAGER is a modular pipeline for generating a knowledge graph from raw text
  without human intervention. Notably, EAGER uses the knowledge graph to answer questions
  and to explain the reasoning behind the derivation of answers. Our demonstration
  will showcase both the automated knowledge graph generation pipeline and the explainable
  question answering functionality. Lastly, we outline open problems and directions
  for future work.'
