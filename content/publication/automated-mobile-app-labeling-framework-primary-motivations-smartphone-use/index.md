  Purpose

  This paper aims to propose an automated mobile app labeling framework based on a
  novel app classification scheme that is aligned with users’ primary motivations
  for using smartphones. The study addresses the gaps in incorporating the needs of
  users and other context information in app classification as well as recommendation
  systems.



  Design/methodology/approach

  Based on a corpus of mobile app descriptions collected from Google Play store, this
  study applies extensive text analytics and topic modeling procedures to profile
  mobile apps within the categories of the classification scheme. Sufficient number
  of representative and labeled app descriptions are then used to train a classifier
  using machine learning algorithms, such as rule-based, decision tree and artificial
  neural network.



  Findings

  Experimental results of the classifiers show high accuracy in automatically labeling
  new apps based on their descriptions. The accuracy of the classification results
  suggests a feasible direction in facilitating app searching and retrieval in different
  Web-based usage environments.



  Research limitations/implications

  As a common challenge in textual data projects, the problem of data size and data
  quality issues exists throughout the multiple phases of experiments. Future research
  will extend the data collection scope in many aspects to address the issues that
  constrained the current experiments.



  Practical implications

  These empirical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of textual data analysis
  in profiling apps and user context information. This study also benefits app developers
  by improving app descriptions through a better understanding of user needs and context
  information. Finally, the classification framework can also guide practitioners
  in customizing products and services beyond mobile apps where context information
  and user needs play an important role.



  Social implications

  Given the widespread usage and applications of smartphones today, the proposed app
  classification framework will have broader implications to different Web-based application
  environments.



  Originality/value

  While there have been other classification approaches in the literature, to the
  best of the authors’ knowledge, this framework is the first study on building an
  automated app labeling framework based on primary motivations of smartphone usage.
