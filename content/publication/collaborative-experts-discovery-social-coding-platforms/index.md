abstract: The popularity of online social coding (SC) platforms such as GitHub is
  growing due to their social functionalities and tremendous support during the product
  development lifecycle. The rich information of experts' contributions on repositories
  can be leveraged to recruit experts for new/existing projects. In this paper, we
  define the problem of collaborative experts finding in SC platforms. Given a project,
  we model an SC platform as an attributed heterogeneous network, learn latent representations
  of network entities in an end-to-end manner and utilize them to discover collaborative
  experts to complete a project. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from
  GitHub indicate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art
  in terms of a range of performance measures.
