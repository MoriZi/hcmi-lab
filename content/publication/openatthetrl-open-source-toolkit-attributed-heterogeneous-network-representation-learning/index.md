abstract: Learning the latent representations of entities based on their relationships
  and the data associated with them is an essential task in many applications such
  as ranking, recommendation systems, graph-based team formation, keyword search,
  and many more. However, the majority of existing techniques learn the latent representations
  of either network or textual data. Structural embedding techniques suffer from the
  sparsity of real-world networks. Attributes of nodes are a source of rich information
  to ameliorate network embedding vectors which are overlooked in the literature.
  Thus, most existing network representation learning tools capture structural information.
  This paper introduces an open-source toolkit called OpenAttHetRL to learn the latent
  representations of entities based on their both network and textual data in an end-to-end
  fashion. OpenAttHetRL is easy to employ and adapt for a variety of tasks including
  ranking, recommendation systems, and expert finding. OpenAttHetRL aims to provide
  a unified toolkit for data pre-processing, building and training models, and performing
  predictions for a downstream task. It employs a graph convolution network to capture
  the relationships among entities and a kernel pooling technique to preserve the
  similarity of their textual data in the embedding space. We use expert finding in
  community question answering systems to demonstrate how OpenAttHetRL can be trained
  to get latent representations of questions, their askers, tags, and answerers and
  find potential answerers of new questions.
