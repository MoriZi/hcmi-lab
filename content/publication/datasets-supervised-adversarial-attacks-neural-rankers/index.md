abstract: 'We introduce a novel dataset for adversarial rank attacks against neural
  rankers, enabling systematic research on robustness. Unlike prior unsupervised or
  surrogate-based methods, our approach uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create high-quality adversarial examples that
  subtly alter rankings while maintaining coherence and relevance. Built via a self-refining
  LLM-Ranker feedback loop, the dataset includes two tiers: Gold and Diamond, based
  on attack strength, along with rich metadata, ranking labels, and quality metrics.
  Released with code and prompts, it supports training, evaluation, and benchmarking
  of robust ranking systems.'
