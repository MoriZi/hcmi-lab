abstract: 'Real graphs often contain edge and node weights, representing, for instance,
  penalty, distance or uncertainty. We study the problem of keyword search over weighted
  node-labeled graphs, in which a query consists of a set of keywords and an answer
  is a subgraph whose nodes contain the keywords. We evaluate answers using three
  ranking strategies: optimizing edge weights, optimizing node weights, and a bi-objective
  combination of both node and edge weights. We prove that optimizing node weights
  and the bi-objective function are NP-hard. We propose an algorithm that optimizes
  edge weights and has an approximation ratio of two for the unique node enumeration
  paradigm. To optimize node weights and the bi-objective function, we propose transformations
  that distribute node weights onto the edges. We then prove that our transformations
  allow our algorithm to also optimize node weights and the bi-objective function
  with the same approximation ratio of two. Notably, the proposed transformations
  are compatible with existing algorithms that only optimize edge weights. We empirically
  show that in many natural examples, incorporating node weights (both keyword holders
  and middle nodes) produces more relevant answers than ranking methods based only
  on edge weights. Extensive experiments over real-life datasets verify the effectiveness
  and efficiency of our solution.'
