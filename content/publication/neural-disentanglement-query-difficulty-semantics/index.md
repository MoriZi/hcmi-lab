abstract: Researchers have shown that the retrieval effectiveness of queries may depend
  on other factors in addition to the semantics of the query. In other words, several
  queries expressed with the same intent, and even using overlapping keywords, may
  exhibit completely different degrees of retrieval effectiveness. As such, the objective
  of our work in this paper is to propose a neural disentanglement method that is
  able to disentangle query semantics from query difficulty. The disentangled query
  semantics representation provides the means to determine semantic association between
  queries whereas the disentangled query difficulty representation would allow for
  the estimation of query effectiveness. We show through our experiments on the query
  performance prediction; and, query similarity calculation tasks that our proposed
  disentanglement method is able to show better performance compared to the state
  of the art.
