abstract: Many online news agencies utilize the paywall mechanism to increase reader
  subscriptions. This method offers a non-subscribed reader a fixed number of free
  articles in a period of time (e.g., a month), and then directs the user to the subscription
  page for further reading. We argue that there is no direct relationship between
  the number of paywalls presented to readers and the number of subscriptions, and
  that this artificial barrier, if not used well, may disengage potential subscribers
  and thus may not well serve its purpose of increasing revenue. Moreover, the current
  paywall mechanism neither considers the user browsing history nor the potential
  articles which the user may visit in the future. Thus, it treats all readers equally
  and does not consider the potential of a reader in becoming a subscriber. In this
  paper, we propose an adaptive paywall mechanism to balance the benefit of showing
  an article against that of displaying the paywall (i.e., terminating the session).
  We first define the notion of cost and utility that are used to define an objective
  function for optimal paywall decision making. Then, we model the problem as a stochastic
  sequential decision process. Finally, we propose an efficient policy function for
  paywall decision making. The experimental results on a real dataset from a major
  newspaper in Canada show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional paywall
  mechanism as well as the other baselines.
