abstract: "Given a graph\n            G\n            and a vertex\n            q\n\
  \            ∈\n            G\n            , the\n            community search\n\
  \            query returns a subgraph of\n            G\n            that contains\
  \ vertices related to\n            q\n            . Communities, which are prevalent\
  \ in\n            attributed graphs\n            such as social networks and knowledge\
  \ bases, can be used in emerging applications such as product advertisement and\
  \ setting up of social events. In this paper, we investigate the\n            attributed\
  \ community query\n            (or ACQ), which returns an\n            attributed\
  \ community\n            (AC) for an\n            attributed graph\n           \
  \ . The AC is a subgraph of\n            G\n            , which satisfies both\n\
  \            structure cohesiveness\n            (i.e., its vertices are tightly\
  \ connected) and\n            keyword cohesiveness\n            (i.e., its vertices\
  \ share common keywords). The AC enables a better understanding of how and why a\
  \ community is formed (e.g., members of an AC have a common interest in music, because\
  \ they all have the same keyword \"music\"). An AC can be \"personalized\"; for\
  \ example, an ACQ user may specify that an AC returned should be related to some\
  \ specific keywords like \"research\" and \"sports\".\n          \n          To\
  \ enable efficient AC search, we develop the CL-tree index structure and three algorithms\
  \ based on it. We evaluate our solutions on four large graphs, namely Flickr, DBLP,\
  \ Tencent, and DBpedia. Our results show that ACs are more effective and efficient\
  \ than existing community retrieval approaches. Moreover, an AC contains more precise\
  \ and personalized information than that of existing community search and detection\
  \ methods."
