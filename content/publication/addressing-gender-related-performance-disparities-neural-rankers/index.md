abstract: While neural rankers continue to show notable performance improvements over
  a wide variety of information retrieval tasks, there have been recent studies that
  show such rankers may intensify certain stereotypical biases. In this paper, we
  investigate whether neural rankers introduce retrieval effectiveness (performance)
  disparities over queries related to different genders. We specifically study whether
  there are significant performance differences between male and female queries when
  retrieved by neural rankers. Through our empirical study over the MS MARCO collection,
  we find that such performance disparities are notable and that the performance disparities
  may be due to the difference between how queries and their relevant judgements are
  collected and distributed for different gendered queries. More specifically, we
  observe that male queries are more closely associated with their relevant documents
  compared to female queries and hence neural rankers are able to more easily learn
  associations between male queries and their relevant documents. We show that it
  is possible to systematically balance relevance judgment collections in order to
  reduce performance disparity between different gendered queries without negatively
  compromising overall model performance.
